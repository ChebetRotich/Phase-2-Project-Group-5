They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of your company's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create."

    "\n",
    "In recent years, the film industry has experienced rapid growth, with streaming services and traditional studios alike competing for viewers' attention. For companies entering this space, understanding the dynamics of profitability is essential. One of the most influential factors in a movie's financial success is its genre, which can heavily influence production costs, audience appeal, and box office revenue. This report explores the profitability of different film genres, helping new studios make data-informed decisions about which genres to focus on in future productions.\n",

    "As we analyze the trends and performance metrics associated with various genres, our goal is to identify patterns and factors contributing to profitability. This analysis not only focuses on historical box office success but also considers seasonal trends, budget requirements, and audience preferences to create a comprehensive view of genre-driven profitability.\n",
